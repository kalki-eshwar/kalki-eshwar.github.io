SQL queries are generated by the systme to access the databaes(s). The system is capable of autonomously searching for information through the repository to find statistically significant information that could be useful to the user. This project is powered by LLMs through the LangGraph framework. It allows for business professionals to understand raw information in a low-level without the need for technical expertise as the system is capable of displaying information in a user-friendly manner through various charts and diagrams.",
