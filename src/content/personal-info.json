    "Vanakkam! Namaste! Bonjour! Hello!",
    "I'm Raghav, a Computer Science and Engineering student at [link:education:Vellore Institute of Technology], Vellore, and currently a summer intern at [link:work:Foradian Technologies], Bengaluru, India. My journey in technology began with a curiosity about how digital systems work, evolving into a passion for creating meaningful software solutions to combat real-world problems.",
    "Beyond technology, I deeply believe one's true measure lies in the richness of their experiences, driving me to seek out life's mysteries. This conviction led me to chess, where I became a former State Champion, and martial arts, in which I achieved a Ni-Dan (2nd Black Belt).",
    "I also bring hands-on experience as a [link:work:Flutter Developer at Monclarity Solutions Pvt. Ltd.], where I developed finance applications and integrated APIs to connect various services. Additionally, as a [link:work:Security Compliance Intern at Valsco Technology], I created security policies adhering to data governance and compliance standards, designed security protocols across systems to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, and developed a tiered response system for security incidents.",
    "In parallel, I've cultivated extensive leadership experience, having been elected as the House Vice Captain and Head Boy in high school (9th and 10th grade respectively), and served as Member Secretary of the Student Council at VIT for the academic year 2024-25."
